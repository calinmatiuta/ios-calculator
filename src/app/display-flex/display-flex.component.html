      Este unul dntre regizorii mei preferati si asta de cand am vazut Gegen die
      Wand prin 2004. Apoi au urmat o serie de filme printre care Crossing the
      Bridge: The Sound of Istanbul, Auf der anderen Seite, Soul Kitchen, The
      Cut si Aus dem Nichts. Asa ca am o veste buna pentru fanii lui Akin. „The
      Golden Glove”/„Mănușa de Aur”, cel mai nou film semnat de Fatih Akin, un
      thriller șocant despre Fritz «Fiete» Honka, criminalul în serie care
      ultragiat Hamburgul în anii ‘70, ajunge pe marile ecrane din România din
      21 iunie, distribuit de Independența Film. Inspirat de un caz real și
      având la bază bestsellerul scris de Heinz Strunk, „The Golden Glove”spune
      povestea lui Fritz «Fiete» Honka (Jonas Dassler), un ucigaș în serie care
      ataca femeile din districtul felinarelor roșii din Hamburg, atrăgându-le
      în apartamentul său din mansardă. Teribil de incomod, nerecomadat
      sensibililor și interzis minorilor, „The Golden Glove”a șocat audiența
      încă de la premiera din cadrul Festivalului de Film de la Berlin prin
      abordarea deosebit de brutală a vieții mizere și crimelor teribile
      înfăptuite de Fritz «Fiete» Honka.History of the blog Blogs started out as
      a natural extension of the increased use of computers and the creation of
      the earliest forms of the Internet as government military, scientific and
      academic networks. Before the World Wide Web, communities of people
      interacted on these networks. Individuals created content for themselves
      or others and stored that content on computers that were connected to the
      networks. Before blogs became popular, these communities often
      communicated and shared frequently-updated content through community
      message boards. The term “newsgroups” became coined to describe many of
      these discussion and information-sharing areas. The earliest true blogs
      started appearing around 1994 or 1995 as open access diaries where
      individuals shared updates about their lives, such as personal thoughts
      and facts about events related to their families, academic studies,
      career, travels and other topics. Early online diary writers include
      Claudio Pinhanez, Justin Hall and Carolyn Burke. The media and public
      really started noticing the content and documenting its formation around
      approximately 1996 and 1997. The exact date and year of the first use of
      the term “blog” is still debated by scholars. Most believe that it
      happened in 1999 as the natural truncation of a particular description of
      this type of content, “web log” or “weblog,” into the shortened form. Some
      debate exists on pronunciation. Obviously, the term describes a diary or
      log located and accessible on the World Wide Web. As time passed, some
      people thought that “weblog” should be pronounced “we blog” to refer to
      individuals performing the action of blogging. Blogs vs Websites – What is
      the difference? The primary difference between a blog and a website is
      that a blog is a specific type of content displayed on web pages on a
      website. Confusion often occurs because individuals and representatives of
      businesses often use the two terms interchangeably. For example, someone
      might say that they visited a company’s blog when in fact the blog was
      merely one part of the company’s website. Confusion also occurs because
      platforms that are devoted entirely to blogging create the impression that
      a person’s or company’s blog on one of these platforms is also their
      primary website. To help sort it all out, keep the following in mind: In
      most cases, non-blogging websites are updated with new content less
      frequently then associated blog pages and blog-devoted websites. Blogs
      typically receive weekly, daily or even less than hourly updates. Non-blog
      websites, such as individual personal interest and biography or business
      sites, typically only update their news and blog content at that frequency
      and then add new pages or update some content as needed. Blogs also
      promote discussion. They have comment sections designed to create online
      conversations about blog content and blog owners in a similar fashion as
      comment sections provided to readers by news media platforms and other
      publishers under online articles. You can use my tutorial to learn how to
      build a WordPress website. Blog posts Vs Pages – What is the difference?
      Simply put, the blog content that you pull up in your browser appears on a
      web page. The term “page” describes the document and the location. It is
      important to note that the term “blog” is also frequently used to describe
      a collection of web pages that specifically share blog content, especially
      on blog-focused websites. This usage is similar to how people describe a
      collection of pages in a diary, journal or log collectively as the object.
      As previously mentioned, blog content is updated frequently. Many websites
      have non-blog pages that contain content that rarely changes, such as a
      company’s history page or contact page. Some web pages have not been
      updated beyond a few tiny refreshed and new content changes in years.
      Popularity Of Blogs & Blogging A lot of people wonder why blogs and
      blogging have become so popular. Blogs provide a social outlet. Many
      people, by nature, are social animals. They actively seek out other people
      offline or online for interaction and sharing of knowledge and
      perspectives. Even many people who are anti-social in face-to-face,
      offline settings enjoy interacting online through social networks using
      their true identities or anonymous personas. Since a blog is a social
      tool, creating or reading blogs provides them with a better alternative
      method for interacting with others that did not previously exist.

    La prima vedere, Fritz „Fiete” Honka este un ratat demn de milă. Bărbatul cu
    fața distrusă își petrece nopțile la „Mănușa de Aur”, barul din cartier, în
    timp ce urmărește femei singure. Niciunul dintre obișnuiții barului nu
    suspectează că aparent inofensivul Fiete este, de fapt, un monstru. Filmul
    lui Fatih Akin spune povestea reală a lui Fritz Honka, un bărbat care a ucis
    și transat cel puțin patru femei, și a barului său preferat, unde cântecele
    germane siropoase fac bețivii să lăcrimeze, iar alcoolismul este un reflex
